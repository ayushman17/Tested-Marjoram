I Trained a Computer🖥️ to recognize a [HUMAN], [MOBILE PHONE], [BALL], [BOTTLE].I train an image classifier and import the machine learning model into a p5.js sketch with the ml5.js library. 

### Prerequisites

* No previous knowledge necessary, but some experience in Scratch, HTML, or Javascript will help.
* Knowing how to use a web browser, and word processing is required.

### Materials

* Laptops or computers with webcams are required. 
* The program will run on a chromebook, however the power of the computer affects performance, so the framerate could drop on machines like a chromebook.


## Built With

* 🔗 [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/)
* 🔗 [p5.js](https://p5js.org)
* 🔗 [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
